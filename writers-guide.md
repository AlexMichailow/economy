## P2P blog post goals and principles 
With every piece of content we produce, it’s important that it works towards our goal of providing actionable value to the reader.

So with every piece of content, we aim to:

* Educate. If we are to push the industry into the mainstream, it’s important that we tell the readers what they need to know, not just what we want to say. We must understand their current level of knowledge, meet them there, and tell them the things they need to know in order to help them move to the next stage of awareness.

* Guide. We are the experts, our opinion is valued. But we mustn’t be arrogant with that. Our world can be complicated, and difficult to understand. It’s our job to gently guide the reader to where we want them to be.

* Respect. It’s important to put yourselves in the shoes of the reader. Communicate with them, don’t patronize. Be considerate and inclusive of all readers, don’t include opinions that will marginalize. Remember, their time is valuable, don’t waste it.

* Be truthful. If we are to be an authority, it’s important that the reader can trust us. A story may sound better with exaggeration, and amazing claims, but it may destroy our relationship.

* Empower. It’s important that we empower and inspire our readers to push for continued growth. Highlight opportunities and encourage them to take action.

For us to achieve these goals, our content must:

* Be clear. The nature of the blockchain industry means that it’s full of technical jargon, and this is a technical blog which means it’s at the more complex end of the spectrum. So while we need to use words that resonate with the reader and show them that we know what we’re talking about, we should be clear and concise with how we communicate. We need to work twice as hard to make the content easy to digest.

* Useful. Before writing, ask yourself these key questions: Who is the reader? What purpose does it serve? Does it add value? What do they need to know?

* Friendly. In a world full of groundbreaking technology, it’s important to remember… we are human. It’s OK to break grammatical rules if our content is warm and helps to build rapport with the reader.

* Appropriate. Consider who our reader is. Our main persona is a developer and this is a professional blog. As is the case in face-to-face communication, adapt your tone to suit the reader. 


## Style guide
- Do not use title case in your title. Capitalize the first word and proper nouns only. This goes for section headers, too.
- Use h4 for section headers, and h5 for subsection headers. Aka, h2 = h4, h3 = h5. We do not have an h4 equivalent, and you should never use h1.
- Include a header image that is 1200 x 600 px.
- Never put anything in a quote to emphasize it, or to note an edge case, etc. Instead, write **Note:** and put your note there.
- Use clear, concise language and short sentences. When in doubt, use shorter paragraphs and shorter sentences. If you have a sentence that runs three lines long, then try to break it up. This makes blog posts much easier to read on mobile.
- Use a conversational tone that’s familiar, but not informal. 
- Use contractions (i.e., 'we’re' vs. 'we are').
- Only 1 space after a period or colon.
- Capitalize the first letter in every sentence.
