**Blockchain as an Enabler of the P2P Economy**

History doesn&#39;t repeat itself, but it often rhymes. A quote attributed to Mark Twain, summarizing in a few words that certain elements of history will come back, albeit in a different form, appropriate to the context of the times. The advent of Bitcoin and the underlying blockchain technology is a boost to the global peer-to-peer (P2P) economy. It&#39;s an economy that harks back to pre-money days, where individuals exchange goods and services between themselves. Add together with blockchain technology, and we have a societal recipe with elements of capitalism, libertarianism, and socialism.

This article will go in depth on the influence of blockchain technology on the P2P economy, blockchain&#39;s influence on what we perceive as law, and its influence on major political paradigms that have come to define the twentieth and twenty-first century.

**Blockchain&#39;s Influence on the P2P Economy**

The world is changing at an increasingly rapid pace. Today, we&#39;re in the age of participation, and it&#39;s a genuine movement. The Internet has enabled networks and communities to work on global challenges. Although the boundaries are loose, the [main fields that this trend spans across](https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/better-work-together-reflections-from-a-nascent-movement/2019/03/05) are the sharing &amp; collaborative economy, the open source &amp; decentralization community, and digital nomads &amp; freelancer collectives.

This movement has led to a sustainable, scalable, and digital P2P economy. First popularized in 1999 by file-sharing systems such as Napster, the Internet allowed millions of people to connect directly with each other and collaborate on whatever they wanted to. It led to the development of P2P networks, where every participating individual was an equal peer node, i.e. both &quot;client&quot; and &quot;server&quot; to everyone else on the network. This is different from what&#39;s up until today the most popular network: a client-server model where communication is to and from a central server.

The idea of a P2P economy has gradually become more popular, and it branched out into what&#39;s now called the &quot;sharing economy&quot;, an economic model where people acquire, provide, or share access to certain underused goods or services, through a community-based online platform. A prime example is Uber, where almost any individual can register as an Uber driver and use their car to earn money by driving people around who need a ride. Other examples are home sharing platforms such as Airbnb or freelancing platforms such as Upwork.

Of course, the platforms listed above aren&#39;t quite in the spirit of P2P. After all, participants using these platforms are not equal peer nodes, because the platforms run on centralized servers that participants communicate with. Nor are these platforms community-driven. Instead, they&#39;re driven by dedicated teams that are ultimately incentivized by money. As such, because they facilitate sharing, they take a significant portion of the money that&#39;s exchanged between two participants.

This is one of the main reasons why blockchain technology has been labeled as disruptive. Finally, the P2P economy has a way to exchange value between two individuals without needing to trust a third party, while eliminating the possibility of fraud and providing unparalleled transparency. Additionally, in true P2P fashion, nodes on a public blockchain serve as both client and server.

Blockchain technology could allow for a similar concept to Uber, but without the company Uber. People could place their car as a digital asset on an &quot;Uber blockchain&quot; and receive cryptocurrency directly from the people they drive around. There would be no centralized entity that determines the rules or that takes a significant portion of the value exchanged between two individuals.

While blockchain technology is certain to accelerate the P2P and sharing economy, it&#39;s disruptive in many other ways too. Quite significantly, blockchain can change the way we create and obey the law.

**Blockchain&#39;s Influence on the Law**

The law is a set of rules that define the boundaries of all aspects of society. However, the rise of the Internet and the increased number of people participating in the P2P and sharing economy has been a problem for the law. After all, communities on the Internet often supersede the typically national boundaries of the regulatory frameworks that we otherwise operate in.

As such, the platforms of the sharing economy have actually been quite useful for governments. In his paper &quot;[Self-regulation and Regulatory Intermediation in the Platform Economy](https://blog.p2pfoundation.net/self-regulation-and-regulatory-intermediation-in-the-platform-economy/2019/03/15)&quot;, Christoph Busch says that platforms such as Airbnb, Uber, and Amazon Marketplace are part of the regulatory chain and serve as regulatory intermediaries.

Indeed, these platforms are often quite efficient at enforcing regulatory requirements on their users through algorithms. Airbnb worked together with the UK government to enforce a 90-day rental cap on short-term rentals in London. Enforcing this for Airbnb was a matter of writing algorithms and communicating the message.

This leads us to an interesting new development, where law is enforced by algorithms and code. In fact, &quot;code is law&quot; is increasingly used as the phrase to indicate that code is becoming the predominant way to regulate the behavior of Internet users.

However, blockchain technology can make this go a step further. In a research paper on [blockchain technology as regulatory technology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.02507), Primavera De Filippi and Samer Hassan say that we might be moving from &quot;code is law&quot; to &quot;law is code&quot;. Where &quot;code is law&quot; means that existing legal rules are incorporated into and regulated by code, &quot;law is code&quot; means that code could be used to draft and elaborate upon legal rules.

This would be done with the so-called smart contracts on blockchain technology, which are secure mechanisms for electronic collaborations between two parties that don&#39;t rely on a central, trusted authority. Smart contracts can serve both as support or as replacement to legal contracts.

An example is [Melonport](https://melonport.com/), a Swiss blockchain company founded in July 2016 that allows anyone to set up and manage a digital asset fund. Whereas traditional asset management requires a lot of middlemen (a fund admin, an operations team, a trading desk, etc…), Melonport developed a protocol, called watermelon, that uses decentralized platforms for both front- and backend.

This means you&#39;re able to take other people&#39;s money and invest it in digital assets without requiring any middleman. The people that give you their money can trust you, because everything is encoded transparently into smart contracts on the relevant blockchains of the watermelon protocol.

**Blockchain&#39;s Influence on Political Paradigms**

Ever since its inception, blockchain technology (and the P2P economy) has been associated with libertarianism. It&#39;s easy to understand why. Libertarianism focuses on the individual, with freedom of speech, freedom of worship, and moral autonomy as primary political values. Anything built on blockchain technology falls in line with the hyper-individualistic tendencies of libertarianism.

Additionally, libertarians don&#39;t like government control. They believe that a government&#39;s role is to protect the rights of its individuals, and anything it ratifies beyond that is overreach. That&#39;s why they like cryptocurrencies, because they take away power from a government that otherwise controls the supply of money. The miners of a blockchain receive the money that they worked for, not the government. And most cryptocurrencies are quite anonymous too, another plus.

But there&#39;s no denying that there are elements of socialism in blockchain technology as well. Socialism states that the production and distribution of goods and services is owned by society as a whole, not by specific individuals or entities.

Capitalism inherently requires hierarchy, because business owners own the means of production as well as the product, and pay for labor to carry out the production process. But blockchain technology allows for a non-hierarchical organization, where the person carrying out the labor owns the final product. No one in particular (or everyone, depending on how you look at it) owns the production process.

Karl Marx predicted that the abuse of power from business will lead to a revolt of the working class. This, in turn, will lead to socialism, and eventually communism, where power will be distributed among all. Blockchain technology is decentralized by its very nature. No single entity controls it. Everyone is equal too, and participants are anonymous. These are all features that Marx would approve of.

**In Conclusion**

While it&#39;s tempting to zoom in to a specific use case, sometimes it&#39;s worth taking a step back and looking at the big picture of a technology; at the trends it accelerates or enables. Blockchain technology came at a time when people were starting to take the P2P economy seriously. While tech platforms such as Uber could be considered a branch of the P2P economy, blockchain technology offers a purer alternative, where communities are truly decentralized and no central entity has all the power.

Additionally, smart contracts built on blockchains allow us not only to rewrite law in code, but to create enforceable and transparent law _from_code. This is necessary at a time where many communities supersede the rules of national regulatory frameworks.

Finally, blockchain technology and the accompanying P2P economy provide people with a way to organize themselves that doesn&#39;t require a strict hierarchy. Although often considered a libertarian technology for its empowerment of the individual, blockchain technology also has elements of socialism and even communism. While this is unlikely to lead to a sudden overthrow of capitalism, blockchain technology at least gives us the tools to work together collaboratively in flexible, trustless ways that don&#39;t enable abuse of power.
