At its core Nucypher is a proxy re-encryption protocol built to secure data exchange and transfers inside public blockchain (like Ethereum, EOS, NEO etc), decentralized apps ecosystems and distributed file systems or storage services.

What’s really significant it’s the ability of Nucypher to handle the most useful yet the worst trait of public blockchains — transparency. It’s nice to be able to track your own transactions, but could easily switch to a paranoia, when I think of someone else tracking them. The other case is sensible DApp data, as described in the subtitle example, it could be patients’ cards, documents, passwords, who knows what else, that could ascend in wrong hands.  

If only your application is not designed to be a direct peer-to-peer radio station or uses private network, it would always touch the outside world to exchange the data, meaning its ecosystem is in danger.  

Basically, you have to encrypt the most sensible data and choose between two options to let users interact with it:

1.  Send private key to each network participant
    
2.  Decrypt the data with your private key and encrypt the data using recipient’s public key.

**Let’s deal with these ‘keys’ buzz first.**  

**Private key**—your app uses it to decrypt the data that was sent to you or encrypted by you. Thus it’s not wise to share or tell it to anyone. 

**Public key**—is used to encrypt the data, when it’s transferred to a recipient.  

The first option is too risky as the private key is available to anyone, including wrong people. The second requires a solid infrastructure to bear with high loads which are inevitable in case of asymmetric encryption in networks with many participants. 

**— And here comes the NuCypher**

Nucypher, and it’s the most interesting thing, uses miners as proxy servers to re-encrypt, validate and endorse the data without actually disclosing the data to them. Viola!

In simple words, Nucypher’s re-encryption key allows to turn the data, previously encrypted by Alice, into the state where Bob could also decrypt it. While the data is kept in secret to any other party than them. both  

Miner does not process the data on encryption, as in  [Google Cloud KMS](https://cloud.google.com/kms/) and [Amazon CloudHSM](https://aws.amazon.com/ru/cloudhsm/), he receives already encrypted piece instead, so unlike Amazon or Google, he is not aware of what you are sending. In order to intercept and decrypt the data, hackers would need to hack each node in the network, which is quite a tough task.

The Nucypher is built upon two technologies:

1.  nuFHE — Library based on fully homomorphic encryption
    
2.  PRE Umbral —  Proxy re-encryption network 

The first is the key library, which enables you to calculate a new ciphertext, without decrypting the initial ciphertext. The second is the network, where re-encryption is presented by validator nodes.  

**Let’s check the real life example once again**: 

So, Alice wants to transfer some sensible data to Bob.

Each of them has his/her own set of keys, which would be used to securely broadcast a message through a public blockchain. At the beginning, Alice encrypts the message with her own symmetric key and then encrypts it one more time using her private key. Afterwards, she sends the encrypted data to the cloud storage alongside the symmetric key.

Using both her private key and Bob’s public key, Alice crafts a re-encryption key, which would be split by parts and parts are shared with each node in the Nucypher ecosystem.

And what about Bob? He downloads the encrypted data alongside Alice’s symmetric key and sends the key back to network nodes. Nodes, at their turn, use parts of Alice’s re-encryption key to re-encrypt Alice’s symmetric key to fit Bob’s private key. Network participants send parts of re-encrypted Alice’s symmetric key to Bob. Bob gathers its pieces together, creates new re-encryption key and uses it together with Bob’s symmetric key to decrypt the original data.

This is how the problem described in the subtitle could be solved. Seems complicated? Not, if the aim is to hide what needs to be hidden. 

**Rewards & Tokenomics**

Token NKMS would be used to secure the network and motivate nodes to play fare: create re-encryption keys and provide operations, and additionally achieve improved decentralization. The network would generate rewards in NKMS and allocate them between valid nodes. The bigger is the validator’s NKMS stake, the more chances its node has to re-encrypt the key and get rewarded.  

Tokens in Nucypher ecosystem could be locked for different periods of time depending on your ambitions and desires. The diagram below illustrates the daily compensation rate over time, assuming 60% tokens locked for lock times of 1 year (blue) and 1 month (red).

The chart below reflects the total amount of compensation product by staking with rewards restaking (blue) and without (red), when staking for 1 year or more (solid lines) or 1 month.

As you can see, over 500% ROI is predicted, when tokens are locked for a year and more, and re-staked once again. Look like a gold mine, isn’t it? With recent successful security audits, the NuCypher is considered to be one of the most promising networks of 2019.
